Boat Image Classification using CNN

Project Overview:
This project focuses on building a deep learning model using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to classify boat images into distinct categories such as:
•	Gondola
•	Motorboat
•	Ferry
The task is framed as a Supervised Learning problem, where the model learns from labeled training data to predict the correct boat category for unseen images.

Objectives:
•	Apply Supervised Learning techniques to solve an image classification problem.
•	Design and train a CNN architecture tailored for boat image recognition.
•	Evaluate model performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and confusion matrix.
•	Demonstrate the practical application of deep learning in computer vision.


Tech tools:
•	Programming Language: Python
•	Deep Learning Frameworks: TensorFlow 
•	Data Handling & Visualization: NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
•	Environment: Jupiter Notebook
